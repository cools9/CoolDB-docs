## API Overview

Welcome to the **CoolDB API** documentation! The CoolDB API is designed to provide developers with a simple and efficient way to interact with the CoolDB in-memory key-value store. Written in Go, it offers high-performance operations, allowing you to easily integrate CoolDB into your applications.

The API runs locally on a server, offering various endpoints to manage your data. This section provides an overview of the core API features, supported operations, and how to get started with using CoolDB via the API.

### Key Features
- **High Performance:** Interact with CoolDB's cache-based memory model through a fast, Go-powered API.
- **Lightweight and Scalable:** Ideal for quick caching or more complex data operations.
- **Local Server:** The API runs locally, giving you full control over your data environment.

### API Authentication

CoolDB's API currently does not require authentication for local setups, making it easy to get started. For production environments, consider adding custom authentication mechanisms.

### Error Handling

CoolDB API follows a simple and consistent error-handling approach. The errors are returned in JSON format with an appropriate status code.

- **404 Not Found:** If the key is not found.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Key not found"
  }
  ```

- **400 Bad Request:** For invalid input or request format.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid request"
  }
  ```

## Code Examples

### 1. **Using cURL**

You can interact with the CoolDB API using simple `cURL` commands. Hereâ€™s an example of how to insert a key-value pair:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/data \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"key":"exampleKey","value":"exampleValue"}'
```

### 2. **Using Go**

Here's how to make an API request using Go's `http` package:
```go
package main

import (
  "bytes"
  "encoding/json"
  "net/http"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  data := map[string]string{
    "key":   "exampleKey",
    "value": "exampleValue",
  }
  jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(data)

  resp, err := http.Post("http://localhost:8080/data", "application/json", bytes.NewBuffer(jsonData))
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer resp.Body.Close()
}
```

### Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of the CoolDB API, you can dive deeper into specific use cases:
- **Explore More Endpoints:** Check the full list of supported API endpoints.
- **Get Started:** Set up CoolDB locally and start interacting with the API.
- **API Authentication (Future):** Plan for integrating authentication when moving to a production environment.
